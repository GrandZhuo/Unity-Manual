# Graphics

![](http://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/GraphicsIntroPic.jpg)

Unity offers amazing visual fidelity, rendering power and ambience.

Make your game look just how you envisaged it with Real-time Global Illumination and our physically-based shader. From luminous day, to the gaudy glow of neon signs at night; from sunshafts, to dimly lit midnight streets and shadowy tunnels – create an evocative dynamic game to enthrall players on any platform.

This section explains all you need to know about Lighting, Cameras, Materials, Shaders & Textures, Particles & Visual Effects, and much more.
