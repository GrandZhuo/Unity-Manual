Unity empowers game designers to make games. What’s really special about Unity is that you don’t need years of experience with code or a degree in art to make fun games. There are a handful of basic workflow concepts needed to learn Unity. Once understood, you will find yourself making games in no time. With the time you will save getting your games up and running, you will have that much more time to refine, balance, and tweak your game to perfection.

This section will explain the core concepts you need to know for creating unique, amazing, and fun gameplay. The majority of these concepts require you to write **Scripts**. For an overview of creating and working with Scripts, read the [Scripting](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html) page.
