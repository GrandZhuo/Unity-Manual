# 动画控制器

<!-- An Animator Controller allows you to arrange and maintain a set of animations for a character or other animated Game Object. -->

动画控制器允许你为一个角色或其他游戏对象安排和维护一组动画。

<!-- The controller has references to the animation clips used within it, and manages the various animation states and the transitions between them using a so-called **State Machine**, which could be thought of as a kind of flow-chart, or a simple program written in a visual programming language within Unity. -->

控制器引用了动画剪辑，并且使用 **状态机** 来管理各种动画状态和它们之间的转换，可以把状态机认为是一种流程图，或者是一段在 Unity 中用可视化编程语言编写的简单程序。

<!-- The following sections cover the main features that Mecanim provides for controlling and sequencing your animations. -->

下面的章节涵盖了 **动画系统 Mecanim** 提供的控制和序列化动画的主要功能。
