# Legacy Shaders

Prior to the introduction of the [Physically Based Standard Shader](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-StandardShader.html), Unity was supplied with more than eighty built-in shaders which each served different purposes. These shaders are still included and available for use in Unity for backwards compatibility but we recommend you use the Standard Shader wherever possible for new projects.

This section begins by explaining how to use the legacy built-in shaders to maximum effect. The remainder of the section details all the available shaders, grouped into related “families”.
